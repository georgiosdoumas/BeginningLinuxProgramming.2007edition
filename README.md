# BeginningLinuxProgramming.2007edition
Here I will place code examples from the book Beginning Linux Programming 4th edition 2007 (Wrox publisher) , that had any kind of mistake in the printed book. Also program examples that I have modified from how they are presented in the book , in ways that helped me to experiment on a feature and understand something better.
